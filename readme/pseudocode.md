make a button to start the game, and then disappear

How do i store my  questions and answers?

==> lets do it in an array

format for a question:

(question)
(multiple choice)
(answer)

[questionOne = {
    question: "how old are you",
    choices: [2, 3, 4, 5],
    answer: 5
}

questionOne = {
    question: "how old are you",
    choices: [2, 3, 4, 5],
    answer: 5
}

questionOne = {
    question: "how old are you",
    choices: [2, 3, 4, 5],
    answer: 5
}

questionOne = {
    question: "how old are you",
    choices: [2, 3, 4, 5],
    answer: 5
}]

Array of Objects

2. how can i get each question to 

for(var i = 0, i < questionband.length; i++) {
    var question = questionbank[i]. question
    var choices
    var answers
}

target some element on the page using queryselector and text content to display that question or choices or answer to the page?

3. how can i check whether the user picked the right answer?

is there a way to click a button? addeventlistener.
=> generate an element that is a button, with an addeventlistener., whichever is clicked on, check against the answer!
 -> if/else
